//Please write a program in which you are assigning those values to variables with the right (specific) data type:

fun main(){
    var myString : String = "Android Masterclass"

    val myFloat : Float = 13.37F

    val myDouble: Double = 3.14159265358979

    var mySort : Short = 25

    var myInt : Int = 2020

    var myLong : Long = 18881234567

    var myBoolean : Boolean = false

    var myChar: Char = 'a'

    println(myString)
    println(myChar)
    println(myFloat)
    println(myInt)
    println(myLong)
    println(mySort)
    println(myDouble)
    println(myBoolean)


   /*
        Please don't simply use Kotlin's powerful type inference feature for this.


        For example, write

        var age : Short = 25

        and not

        var age = 25



        even though both are correct. This is just for testing your understanding of the different basic data types.
        All of them should be "var", except for the pi value and 13.37, use "val" here.
        Try to use descriptive and useful names
